# Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks-KAN
I have implemented KAN using B-splines in a more efficient manner to enhance its performance. Additionally, I have thoroughly tested its performance on various datasets including MNIST, Air Passengers, and CIFAR-10.

I will soon upload the results of all my experiments to provide a comprehensive overview of KAN's performance across different datasets.
