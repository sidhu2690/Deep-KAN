# Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks-KAN
I have implemented KAN using B-splines in a more efficient manner to enhance its performance. Additionally, I have thoroughly tested its performance on various datasets including MNIST, Air Passengers, and CIFAR-10.

I will soon upload the results of all my experiments to provide a comprehensive overview of KAN's performance across different datasets.

# Deep-KAN

Deep-KAN is a Python package for implementing Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks (KAN). 
You can find the package [here](https://pypi.org/project/Deep-KAN/).

# MLP v/s KAN
